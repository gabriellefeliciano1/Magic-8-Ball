    "Coming into this class, I had no coding experience whatsoever. Prof Ellis taught me everything I know about coding today!  It was a great experience learning something completely new. I learned about the input function and how it gives a nice space for a user to type into a box. It makes it seem very interactive. I challenged myself with learning how to properly test the functions I've written to ensure they work as a unit. It was challenging to find out how to test a function with loops and conditional statements."
